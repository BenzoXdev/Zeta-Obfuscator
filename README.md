# Zeta Obfuscator Tool

The tool provides fully secure and unbreakable obfuscation, ensuring maximum protection against reverse engineering and hacking. All obfuscated scripts become completely undetectable by antivirus software, guaranteeing full stealth. Once obfuscated, the code can be converted into an .exe, further enhancing security and protection against cracking attempts.
